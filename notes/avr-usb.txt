AVR Micocontrollers with USB Support

Arduino is a wonderful platform for designers, artists and anybody who doesn't want to spend hours picking out chips and learning the AVR toolchain. But for tasks that require high-speed data acquisition, the Arduino has a fatal flaw: no built-in USB means that funneling data to a PC is suboptimal. The Arduino uses an FTDI chip to do serial to USB conversion, which doesn't allow you you to take full advantage of USB speed.

AVR offers a number of ATMega chips with built-in USB capability that can give you better data throughput. This page collects notes on how to find and use these chips.
